# Hey Folks! 
I'm Gianluca Aguzzi, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bologna. 
I have a passion for all things related to [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) and [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system). 
My research focuses on engineering [collective adaptive systems](https://www.unige.ch/cui/cas/).

In this field, I am interested in both manual techniques like [aggregate computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7274429) and multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning.

Recently, I've also started exploring the application of foundational models in software engineering, from requirement management to development.

I am also a passionate Scala enthusiast, and in my free time (if it even exists!), I use my Nintendo Switch to unwind and reflect ðŸ‘€
## > Teaching

Currently, I'm an adjunct professor at the University of Bologna. 
For the latest updates on my courses, please refer to the [official website](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/gianluca.aguzzi).

## > Thesis
If you are interested in themes like swarm robotics, autonomous agents with LLMs, or multi-agent reinforcement learning, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always looking for motivated students to work with.
For some ideas, you can check out my [thesis proposals](/thesis).
