I love computer science because it allows me to shape my ideas in a short time. I'm just lazy enough to be able to get away from work.

I've always been fascinated by technology because everything seemed like magic to me as a child. Understanding its dynamics has also made everything more magical and fascinating.

My current interests concern machine learning algorithms, functional languages, design patterns, architectural pattern, and mixing the AI techniques with standard programming techniques.
