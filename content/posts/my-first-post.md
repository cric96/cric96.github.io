In a social network era, what the hell bring me to build a personal website? So, mainly I choose to do so for:
- having my place in which post my research/activity in a non-standard format
- studying modern technologies for building static website (like Hugo, Actions)
- Enjoying :)
I am not a verbose guy, so I don't have as much to say about my decision. For apologizing, I drop here a kitten.
