My current research topics concern large-scale system coordination and machine learning algorithm in distributed systems.
In my research group, we study a technique called Aggregate Computing, a top-down declarative approach to coordinate collective behaviour.
 Over the years, my colleagues developed novel tool-chain to use this new paradigm, such as
[ScaFi](https://scafi.github.io/) and [Protelis](https://protelis.github.io/).

My current trend consists in merging Aggregate Computing with Machine learning, gaining benefits of both worlds.

I am also the creator of [ScaFi-Web](https://scafi.github.io/web/), a web-based tool to use Aggregate Computing directly on the web.
